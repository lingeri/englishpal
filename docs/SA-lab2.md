## Abstract

Use blueprints to refactor Photo String and add a few small features.

## Introduction

A former student developed a web photo album called Photo String for storing photos. He used the Flask micro web framework. Photo String allows the user to upload a picture and add a description for that picture.

In this lab, we are going to use blueprints to refactor Photo String and add a few small features.
